Display big digits in twentieth century high-speed line printer style

The bigdigits program reads a number entered on the command line (as a string), and outputs the same number onto the console using "big" digits. Back in the twentieth century, at sites where lots of users shared a high-speed line printer, it used to be common practice for each user's print job to be preceded by a cover page that showed some identifying details such as their username and the name of the file being printed, using this kind of technique.
